👋  Hi, I’m @gilotin (Nikolay Toshev)
👀 I’m interested in JavaScript and everything about the language (for now).
🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, getting into the world of programming.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything interesting. Practice is the best way to learn.
📫 If you want to contact me, just write me an e-mail : toshevnikolay@gmail.com.
